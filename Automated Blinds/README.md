# Overview
This projected is intended to work with Home Assistant through MQTT. Instead of just opening and closing blinds, I have added other sensors to collect environmental information. This project is reversiable and should not cause any perment damage. The design and software is not perfect, but it works reliably. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

# Features
- Open and close blinds
- Temperature and Humidity sensor
- Light sensor (on a scale between 0-100)
- Window open/close sensor

# Requirements
- Arduino/NodeMCU experience
- Minor soldering skills
- 3D Printer
